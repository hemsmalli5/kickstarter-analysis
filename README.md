# kickstarter-analysis

Outcome Based on Goal:
The analysis conducted on the kickstarter camplaigns parent category theaters and subcategory plays, the campaing outcome (success or failure) based on the goal range, we can determine following:
1. campaigns with goal less than $1000 have higher rate of success.
2. campaign with goal greater than $20,000 have more failure rate except between $35000 to $45000 goal (which may be driven by different factors). With highest fail rate above $45000 goal, itâ€™s possible that the campaigns asked for too high price. This also may indicate that failed campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful campaigns. 
Please note that for this analysis we have limitation: The canceled campaigns remain null for Theater/Plays category.

Outcome based on Launch Date:
The theater campaigns analysis conducted on outcome based on the Launch Date, we can determine following:
1. The campaigns that were launched during May month were most successful. Eventhough the campaign fail rate in May and June were almost nearly half to the success rate, still May and June months can be considered as good time to launch new campaigns. 
2. Another important consideration that Oct has null cancellations, with second highiest failed rate.
3. December being the closest match of success and failed campaigns, it may not be good time for new campaign launches!
